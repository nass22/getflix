# 🎨 Front-End 
For better responsive website and work faster we used (BOOTSTRAP5)
, the main goal is to make the website responsive and easy to navigate in most simple way and the most comfortable for the eyes.

To display the API properly, we used the cards (shadowcard) from BOOTSRAP5.

# ⚙️ Back-End 

## **The session system**
For our session system: (registration, connection) we did a landing page with our logo and to options: one to sign up and an other to log in. You can also log in from the header as well.

When the user arrives on the sign up page, all the informations are sent to the phpMyAdmin and the password is hached. Once the user is signed up he can log in. The user also can chose the "remember me" option.

Once the user is loged in, he have the option to disconnect on the far right of the page. And he can also go to the edit profile page.

##  **User's rights and options**

We used the PDO method to have acces to the database. 

## (Samir, tu pourrais mieux expliquer ici ?)

The user have differents options on the home page. We included different categories for movies and series and we also added a search bar to sort by filters such as movies series or people. 


Once the user clicked the link from he's choice, he's directed to the "movie page" where he as acces to the trailer and can add a comment.
